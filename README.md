## Overview of StockX and The Vault

StockX is an online resale marketplace, serving as an auction facilitator and product authenticator between buyers and sellers, primarily in the secondary sneaker market. The Detroit-based company was founded by Dan Gilbert, Josh Luber, Greg Schwartz, and Chris Kaufman in March 2015 and launched in February 2016. StockX has received backing from Gilbert, investment companies Battery Ventures and GV, and individual investments from from the likes of Scooter Braun, Eminem, Mark WAhlberg, Steve Aoki, and Marc Benioff. The company raised $6 million in February 2017 and then an additional $44 million in a second venture round in September 2018. In another venture round in June 2019, StockX raised $110 million and was valued at $1 billion. In addition to Battery Ventures and GV, investors now included General Atlantic, GGV Capital, and DST Global. By April of 2021, the company said it was valued at $3.8 billion after a secondary tender offering. 

On January 18, StockX CEO Scott Cutler announced the launch of Vault NFTs − NFTs minted by StockX under custodial authority as ERC-1155 on the Etherium blockchain that are attached to their physical sneaker counterpart. The sneakers, and other coveted items StockX says can be may soon be linked to Vault NFTs, are stored in the company's own secure, climate-controlled facility and can be taken posession of at any time. This custom depot for "sneakerhead" entrepreneurs and enthusiasts together with their catalog of digital assets are known collectively as The Vault. StockX also says that Vault NFT holders will have exclusive access to events and offerings on the site. Alongside this exciting announcement, they recently recruited the help of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley ahead of a highly anticipated IPO − expected sometime in the first half of 2022 − which should bring with it a substantial (and tangible) collectibles business to market. 

## Business Activities

When a buyer purchases a Vault NFT, they are buying the corresponding sneaker minted on the token. The actual sneaker is stored in The Vault, saving the buyer closet space, as well as the time and resources required to receive the product and flip it, should that be their aim, which they can do as easily as selling the NFT. This dramatically reduces transaction costs for both parties as well as the environmental impact of the entire marketplace. 

The novelty of Vault NFTs is the significant efficiency they add to an already robust resale market of sneakers, which are themselves already a highly collectible commodity. Sneakers and NFTs make a logical pairing. And while NFTs may be difficult to categorize and value, Cowen Equity Research classified sneakers as an emerging alternative asset class in 2019. So while the intention of this marriage is for NFTs to add efficiency to the resale market, an unintended effect may be that sneakers may in fact lend legitimacy to NFTs. Sneakers are a familiar commodity with a growing capitalization and historical price data for reference (which StockX provides on their website). All of this can add viability to a token market that has been quickly flooded by artistic hopefuls and get-rich-quickers and that has been clouded by fickle meme stock-type investors. Also, StockX has an advantage in bringing this tech to their platform as the market maker for a $6 billion resale market that is predicted to balloon to $30 billion by 2030. However, there is competition for the dollars (and soon cryptocurrency) of digital fashion investors and collectors.

## Landscape

Digital fashion is an industry that has been expanding rapidly as the metaverse takes shape. In December, Nike announced it purchased RTFKT (pronounced "artifact"), a startup leader in digital streetwear and sneakers as downloadable content for gaming and as NFTs. RTFKT has shown there is impressive demand for their unique add-ons in online gaming − now Nike is banking these collectibles will translate analogously to real world streetwear culture, with digital sneaker NFTs being bought up in order to "flex" on people in the metaverse. Several other major players in apparel have made the jump to digital fashion. Ralph Lauren recently launched a digital line of retro winter sportswear from their 1990's collection in the Roblox online universe. in December, Gucci launched an immersive experience in Florence where Florentines can interact with ambitious works of Creative Director Alessandro Michele, and others can access the experience through the virtual Gucci Garden experience in Roblox. Last year Balenciaga released its Fall 2021 collection via a custom video game and collaborated with Fortnite on a line of digital clothing for players. And now that Ye (formerly Kanye West) and Demna Gvasalia have collaborated with Gap on a project called Yeezy Gap Engineered by Balenciaga, speculators imagine the retail giant will make a push in the metaverse. 

All of these digital fashion experiences and collectibles sound fun, and likely very lucrative for the early companies who stake their claim in the metaverse and evolve their products with user trends. But at the end of the day, they still only seem like collectibles with largely the same utility as buying clothes for your own use in the real world. A large percentage of users will likely engage with digital fashion, other digital collectibles, and the metaverse entirely as consumers. But there are more and more people every day willing to do the reserch and leverage these new tools to build their digital portfolios while also taking part in the fun of collectibles and fast evolving pace of digital culture. Vault NFTs may bridge the gap by providing consumers and investors with both a digital and physical asset. These assets offer an opportunity to invest in a real piece of physical culture that can be more easily valued thanks to an exising market, and which, in theory, can actually be worn − not that you would risk creasing them.
> "We’re excited about our digital future − a future where NFTs can be bought and sold across multiple platforms and paid for with cryptocurrency; a future harnessed by new NFT products that empower the creator economy; and a future where web3 unlocks marketplace efficiencies and new experiences for our global community. Our digital future will enable an ever expanding opportunity to trade and consume current culture." −Scott Cutler, CEO StockX
