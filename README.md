## Overview of StockX and The Vault

StockX is an online resale marketplace, serving as an auction facilitator and product authenticator between buyers and sellers, primarily in the secondary sneaker market. The Detroit-based company was founded by Dan Gilbert, Josh Luber, Greg Schwartz, and Chris Kaufman in March 2015 and launched in February 2016. StockX has received backing from Gilbert, investment companies Battery Ventures and GV, and individual investments from from the likes of Scooter Braun, Eminem, Mark WAhlberg, Steve Aoki, and Marc Benioff. The company raised $6 million in February 2017 and then an additional $44 million in a second venture round in September 2018. In another venture round in June 2019, StockX raised $110 million and was valued at $1 billion. In addition to Battery Ventures and GV, investors now included General Atlantic, GGV Capital, and DST Global.

On January 18, StockX CEO Scott Cutler launched Vault NFTs, which allows users to invest in NFTs tied directly to physical items and stored in a custom, climate-controlled warehouse
